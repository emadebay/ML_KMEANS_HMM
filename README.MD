Hand-Solving Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and K-Means Clustering
This repository contains hand-solved examples of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and K-Means Clustering problems. The goal is to provide step-by-step solutions and explanations for understanding these concepts manually.

Problem Descriptions
Hidden Markov Models (HMM): The repository includes hand-solved examples of HMM problems, where we aim to compute probabilities, states, and emissions at each step of the HMM process. This involves understanding the transition probabilities between states and the emission probabilities for each state.
K-Means Clustering: Hand-solved examples of K-Means clustering problems are provided. In these examples, we manually partition a dataset into K clusters based on the Euclidean distance between data points and cluster centers. The goal is to understand how the K-Means algorithm assigns data points to clusters and updates the cluster centers iteratively.

Contents
Each PDF document provides detailed explanations of the problem-solving process for HMM and K-Means clustering.
For HMM problems, the documents cover computations of probabilities, states, emissions, and transitions at each step of the HMM process.
For K-Means clustering problems, the documents explain how data points are assigned to clusters, how cluster centers are updated iteratively, and how the algorithm converges to the final clustering solution.
